  "description": "In many organizations there are specific applications where the per-user license cost is high. Very often, users are provided access to these  applications when they need to complete a task. They later continue to consume a seat license even though they do not access the application any  longer. With this sample workflow template we are able to monitor access to these specific applications and take action, as needed. The value for customers is significant application license cost savings.",
